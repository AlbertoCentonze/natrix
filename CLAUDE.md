- When adding or modifying a command in the CLI, the .toml config file should be updated as well.
- Every time there is a user facing change the @docs/ should be updated according to @docs/CONTRIBUTING.md
- When making a new rule you need to assign "NTX<seq>" code, always use the highest seq value that has yet not been used.
- When testing if a change to the codebase affected the CLI result you can use contracts in @tests/contracts/ instead of creating dummy one you then have to delete.
